I built constructed a  genetic algorithm model in MATLAB that simulated the evolution of optimal trade-offs that led to optiimal drought resistance. This evolution took place to droughts occurring - a condition mimicking our current environment. My experiment replicated this  across environments that had increasing levels of droughts.
